 üßæ Invoice-Transcriber
 
Invoice-Transcriber is a lightweight project designed to demonstrate front-end and back-end integration, while showcasing the use of AI models for intelligent document processing.

üöÄ Overview

Users interact with a simple webpage where they can upload an invoice. The flow is as follows:
- The HTML form sends the uploaded file to a PHP script.
- The PHP script triggers a Python script that performs the core processing.

üß† AI-Powered OCR

The Python script leverages two AI models for Optical Character Recognition (OCR), each optimized for different file types: deepseek-r1 from LM Studios and llama3.2-vision:11b from Ollama. Each model handles different file types. The DeepSeek model transcribes PDF files, while the llama model handles image files (.jpg, .jpeg, .png). If an invoice contains both text and images, both models are used in tandem to ensure complete transcription.

üñºÔ∏è Image Transcription Workflow

- Images are broken into chunks and stored as vectors in a vector database.

- The AI model retrieves these chunks to build context and respond accurately.

A question-answer format is used:
- System prompt: Provides general formatting and extraction guidelines.
- User prompt: Contains specific questions to extract key invoice details.
  
The DeepSeek model uses a single system prompt to define the expected output format and content.

üßπ Post-Processing
To clean up the AI output, a parser function is used to extract only the relevant details‚Äîremoving any intermediate or ‚Äúthinking‚Äù text generated by the model.
